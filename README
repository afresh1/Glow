NAME

Glow - Git-like object warehouse

DESCRIPTION

Glow is using and extending the concepts of the Git Object Database,
to provide support for additional objects of any size, with any
relationships between them.

The default Glow implementation provides support for the four kinds of
objects provided by Git: blob, tree, commit and tag.

CAVEAT EMPTOR

Glow started as an exercise to force me to learn Moose while
providing the foundations for a relatively ambitious project:
extend the concepts of the Git object database to support extended
objects of any size.

At this stage, it is still a work in progress, that is far from
being production-ready. It may even change name at some point.

NAMING

The name Glow is an acronym for "Git-like object warehouse".
This is more positive than Gloom ("Git-like objects on Moose")
--besides, there's already a Gloom module on CPAN--
and more general than Globe ("Git-like object backEnd").
It is good enough for now.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Glow is heavily inspired from Git itself, and from the Moose-based,
pure Perl implementation Git::PurePerl.
